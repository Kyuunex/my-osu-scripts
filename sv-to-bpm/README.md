there are 2 versions because why not. python one is newer.

simply run in a command line like `php sv-to-bpm.php` or `python3 sv-to-bpm.py`

it expects `input.txt` to be present in the same folder and it will make `output.txt` with all green lines turned into red lines

`input.txt` should contain timing points obviously. just timing points. nothing else.
