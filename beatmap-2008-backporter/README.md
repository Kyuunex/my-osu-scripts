how to use:

pass in no arguments: the script assume you called it from your songs folder and will treat every subfolder as a mapset, and convert the .osu files inside  

pass in `MAPSET` as an argument: the script assumes you called it from the mapset folder and will check for .osu files in it and convert them  

pass in anything else: the script assumes that is the specific .osu file you want to convert and will convert it  


converted mapsets have a version of 5, and all mapsets 5 or lower are not gonna be converted. so, it's not possible to run this twice and break an already converted set. you can run this on your whole songs folder after you add stuff time to time if you want basically
